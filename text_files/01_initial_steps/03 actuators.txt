1. on build.gradle
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator'

   if using maeven, go to pom.xml, and add actuator dependencies.

2. on src/main/resources/application.properties
        management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info
        management.info.env.enabled=true

   to expose all the endpoints,
        management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

   after exposing all endpoints, if we want to hide some endpoints,
        management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=info

3. now, we can access actuators health and info in our app,
        http://localhost:8080/actuator/info
        http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

4. by default, info is empty {}
    but we can add info via application.properties.

        info.app.name=Sunil's first spring application
        info.app.details=Sunil is learning spring boot and thinks it'll help him a ton in future
        info.app.version=1.0.0

    then actuator/info site will display data as a JSON like:
        {
          "app": {
            "name": "Sunil's first spring application",
            "details": "Sunil is learning spring boot and thinks it'll help him a ton in future",
            "version": "1.0.0"
          }
        }
