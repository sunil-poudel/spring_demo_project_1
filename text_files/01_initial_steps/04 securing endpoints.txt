1. by exposing endpoints, we expose important info
    so we may want to secure them. To do so,
    add security dependency in pom file(if maeven)
    or in gradle do this:
            implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'

2. now, when we try to access any endpoints, we'll be prompted
    to log in. default username is user, password is given in run terminal.
