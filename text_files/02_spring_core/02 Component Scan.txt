1. If we have main @SpringBootApplication annotated class in one package
and our desired injections with components in other package, we need to add these lines
above @SpringBootApplication

    //component scan will now scan both of the packages!
    @ComponentScan(basePackages = {
        "org.sunil_spring_demo.spring_001,
        com.spring_core"})
    @SpringBootApplication

2. Alternative way:
    @SpringBootApplication(
           scanBasePackages = {"org.sunil_spring_demo.spring_001, com.spring_core"}
   )

3. If we have subpackages in same package with main @SpringBootApplication,
we don't have to add component scan.
