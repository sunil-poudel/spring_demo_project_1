1. by default, when application starts, all beans are initialized
    --> @Component etc.

2. spring will create will create new instance of each and make them available.
we can create constructor with some println statement to see proof.

3. instead of creating all beans first, we can specify lazy initialization.
    bean will be initialized only on one of the following cases:
    i. it is needed for dependency injection.
    ii. it is explicitly requested.

   for this, lazy annotation is given to the class.

4. Here in this case, while program is run, only Pokhara and Kathmandu are initialized but
    Dharan will be initialized only when necessary.
        @Component
        @Lazy
        class Dharan implements City{
            public Dharan(){
                System.out.println("Created city "+getClass().getSimpleName());
            }
            @Override
            public String cityCenter() {
                return "Dharan Chowk";
            }

            @Override
            public String specialFeature() {
                return "Green city!";
            }
        }
