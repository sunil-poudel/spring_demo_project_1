Inversion of Control (IoC) means the control of creating objects and managing their dependencies is inverted â€” itâ€™s handled by the Spring container instead of being manually coded by you.

ðŸ§± Without IoC (Traditional Approach):

    Car car = new Car(new Engine()); // You manually create dependencies

âœ… With IoC in Spring:

    @Component
    public class Car {
        private Engine engine; //Engine is interface considering previous txt files 01 and 02.

        @Autowired
        public Car(Engine engine) {
            this.engine = engine;
        }
    }
Now Spring manages how Car gets its Engine.
