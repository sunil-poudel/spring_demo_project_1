1. By default, beans are singleton by default. that means
    if we add multiple qualifiers to inject beans
    they are always pointed to same instance.

    @Autowired
    public RestController(
        @Qualifier("cat") Animal animal1,
        @Qualifier("cat") Animal animal2
    ) {
        this.animal1 = animal1;
        this.animal2 = animal2;
    }

    @GetMapping("/status")
    public String status(){
        return "status: "+(animal1==animal2);
    }

    result will be true, because singleton is default scope.

2. we can make spring to create new instances for each beans we create,
we can do like:
    if we want Cat's instance to be multiple, SCOPE_PROTOTYPE

    @Component
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    public class Cat{
        ...
    }

    and rest same as above.
    the status will be false.
