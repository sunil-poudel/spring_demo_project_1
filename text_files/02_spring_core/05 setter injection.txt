1. done by calling setter methods on our class.

2. steps:
    --> i. create setter methods (we can give any methods
            with autowired, not just setters).
        ii. configure dependency injection with autowired annotation

        //setter injection
        @Autowired
        public void setAnimalRestController(Dog dog){
            this.dog = dog;
        }
