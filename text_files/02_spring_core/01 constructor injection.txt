1.

--> i. create new interface Coach
    ii.
        public interface Coach {
            void getDailyWorkout();
        }

2. Add component annotation to a class,
Component annotation marks class as spring bean, makes it available for
dependency injection.

--> i. Create new class CricketCoach.
    ii. Add component annotation to CricketCoach

        @Component
        public class CricketCoach implements Coach{
            @Override
            public String getDailyWorkout() {
                return "Practice bowling for 10 minutes daily!";
            }
        }

3. Create rest controller.
    Autowired annotation tells Spring to inject dependency,
    optional if there's only one constructor, then create mapping.


@RestController
public class DemoRestController {
    //define private field for the dependency
    private Coach myCoach;

    //define constructor for dependency injection
    @Autowired
    public DemoRestController(Coach coach){
        myCoach = coach;
    }

    //create mapping
    @GetMapping("/dailyWorkout")
    public String getDailyWorkout(){
        return myCoach.getDailyWorkout();
    }
}
