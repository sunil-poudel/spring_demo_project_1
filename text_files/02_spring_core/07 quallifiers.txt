````` Imp! Look till last!!! `````
1. suppose we have multiple implements of Animal each annotated as @Component.
if we do constructor injection, (or setter injection) in such case
there will be error as we have multiple implementations.
For e.g.
    @Component
    public class Dog implements Animal{

    }

    @Component
    public class Cat implements Animal{

    }

    @Component
    public class Sparrow implements Animal{

    }

and in rest controller,
    private Animal animal;

    @Autowired
    public RestController(Animal animal){
        this.animal = animal;
    }

2.  we get error, because there are multiple components Dog, Cat, Sparrow
    so we need to add qualifier to RestController Autowired constructor/setters

    to fix that,
    @Autowired
        public RestController(@Qualifier("dog") Animal animal){
            this.animal = animal;
        }

        //now spring knows it is dog which we are working on, if we set to cat
         or sparrow it'll switch to them.
        //same method for setters as well.

3. Imp: the qualifier name must be same as of component, just small alphabet
    in first character.

    Also I had to make changes to rest controller, go and check that out!!!
