1. In part 1, we saw that we were able to initialize only the required
components by lazy annotation. But to do so for all
components would be tedious. So there is solution for that.

2. so, in application.properties
    spring.main.lazy-initialization=true

    then, all beans are lazy, no beans created until needed.
