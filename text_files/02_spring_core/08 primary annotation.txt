1. Primary can be alternative to qualifiers if we don't want
to be specific.
in such case, we can write Primary annotation  above the
class which implements interface.
e.g. Dog, Cat, Sparrow here for Animal interface.

2. We can mix both Primary and Qualifier, but no use as Qualifier will have
higher priority. So qualifier is recommended, due to specific nature
 and higher priority, unless otherwise. Also, no multiple Primary allowed.

3. example:
    i. Cat class
        @Component
        @Primary
        class Cat implements Animal{

            @Override
            public String produceSound() {
                return "Purrs";
            }
        }

    ii. rest controller
        @Autowired
        public AnimalRestController(Animal animal) {
            this.animal = animal;
        }
        //we see that now no qualifier annotation is needed.
